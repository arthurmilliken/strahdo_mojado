You should get a reading, and stick around for our next installment of Masters of the D, where Anna and I finish our preparation for Strahdo Mojado Chapter 1: Tinok et Ohr, after which our heroes will continue their intrepid exploration of Barovia in Chapter 2: Meat Pies. Thank you for listening, and thank you Gregoire Lourme for your beautiful music track "Insomnia", released through Creative Commons.
