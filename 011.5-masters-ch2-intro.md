Hi, and welcome back to Masters of the D, our behind-the-scenes Dungeon Masters workshop for our Strahdo Mojado campaign. I'm Arthur Milliken.

Today, we will pick up after the conclusion of chapter 1: "Tinok et Ohr", but before our recording of chapter 2: "Meat Pies". My co-Dungeon Master, Anna Wenger, and I, review chapter 1 while planning chapter 2.

Because we launched Strahdo Mojado right in the middle of the action without taking any time to set the stage, this is where we plan to zoom out and establish who our heroes are, where did they come from and why are they participating in this adventure? We also learn how to tell fortunes while reading a Tarokka deck, and map out Tinok's long road to redemption.

If you pay close attention, you will detect a noticeable gap between what we planned and what actually happened during play. For example, I did not anticipate Matt Y playing the role of the Wiz, who was a character from a previous game  played over twenty years ago, and who replaced the messenger delivering Strahd's letter to Tinok and Ken. You will probably notice other scenes which did not go as planned. All Dungeon Masters must learn to expect the unexpected, because it's those unexpected moments which are the true gold of the Maynarding experience.

So, how did it go? Listen and find out. This is a Wet Maynard Production.

As you can probably tell, there is a lot which goes into each game we play. One of those ingredients, of course, is the amazing music playing in the background, which has been made available to us through creative commons. In today's episode, we heard the beautiful guitar solo Blind Fire by Aitua, six passionate accordion tracks from Accordeus, titled Sur le Fil, Cert a Kaca, Cazole, Metsakukkia, Iceberg and Poison Apples. And finally, thanks to Gregoire Lourme for the haunting track Orphanage we are listening to right now. Thanks to all of you whose generosity makes it possible for us to follow our dreams as well as our nightmares. This is a Wet Maynard Production
