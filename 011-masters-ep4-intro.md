Welcome back to Masters of the D. In today's episode, Anna and I continue planning chapter 2: "Meat Pies." We learn how to tell fortunes while reading a Tarokka deck, and map out Tinok's long road to redemption. After that, our discussion takes a personal turn as Anna and I dissect our respective religious orientations. But what does religion have to do with Dungeon Mastering? Many compare the art of DM'ing and world-building to playing the role of God. Others have likened the role of Dungeon Master to that of the Devil himself. The truth may be a little of both, with many shades of gray mixed in between. Whether it's God or Gods, the many worlds of Dungeons and Dragons cannot escape the long shadow cast by religion. This is a Wet Maynard production.
