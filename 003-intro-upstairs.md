With the rolling of initiative, we begin the first real combat encounter of our Curse of Strahd campaign. Buffy's Divine Sense warned us about the upper floors of the Death House, revealing an undead presence lurking above, and the image of Rosavalda Durst mentioned a baby on the third floor. K'K'Ken insists on molesting every dangerous-looking artifact found by the party. When he reached for the weapon wielded by an empty suit of armor, that suit of armor sprang to life. Did K'K'Ken lead our heroes into a deadly trap, or did he in so doing avert an even deadlier ambush further down the road?
