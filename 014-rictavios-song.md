Rictavio's Song
------

Everything about my carnival was spectacular,
Including the price. One Silver.
Now, that might seem a bit steep, but it was worth it.
Look at what I gave them.

Dwarven flagons, pointy teeth of dragons,
A little pinkie from the Hand of Vecna,
Statuary of the Virgin Mary,
Deck of Many Things and other works of art.

Cloak and Boots of Elvenkind, a yellow Belt of Dwarvenkind
An elemental gem, a wailing banshee lock of hair.
Crow and Sioux who're going to be showing you
Some sewing through a feathered hat of leather from an Owlbear.

Yellow molder, eye of a Beholder,
A glowing retna from the Eye of Vecna,
Rain and thunder, from a Wand of Wonder
Something odd, a piece of Rod, the seventh part.

Educated fleas, a studded hide of a displacer beast
A cockatrice's beak, a ring of element commands.
Helms of Brilliance, Bags of Tricks,
Forgotten Realms, and flying sticks,
A knight and Vorpal Weapon, wielded with two hands!

Scales of Naga, Hut of Baba Yaga,
Got no Bag of Holding but we're getna,
When you duck out, wanna get the fuck out,
Run around the keep and see the
Run around the keep and see the
Run around the keep and see the Borderlands!

Everything about my museum was spectacular,
Including the price. One Dollar.
Now, that might seem a bit steep, but it was worth it.
Look at what I gave them.

Quite a lotta Roman Terracotta,
Living lava from the flanks of Etna,
Statuary, Ride a Dromedary,
See the temple tumble and the Red Sea part.

MacNamara's band, the fattest lady in the land,
A pickled prehistoric hand, a strand of Pocahontas' hair.
Crow and Sioux who're going to be showing you
Some rowing through a model of the rapids on the Delaware.

Armadillas, clever caterpillars,
Reproductions of the cyclops' retna,
Crystal blowing, automatic sewing,
Venus on a shell and other works of art.

Educated fleas, a tribe of aborigines,
Two ladies joined across the knees,
A Mona Lisa made of ice.
Hottentots, we've gotten in
Forgotten spots, a cotton gin,
A night with Lot in Sodom, better see that twice.

One iguana, snakes and other fauna,
Got no bearded lady but we're getna,
When you duck out, take another buck out,
Run around the block and see a new show start!
