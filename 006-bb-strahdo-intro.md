Tinok et Aur. Minwin, can you explain the meaning of the name Tinok et Aur?

...

Tinok is dead -- his skull having been split open by the business end of a heavy mace, wielded by Tinok himself. Tinok's ankles are bound by manacles, and he hangs upside down over a bloodstained altar resting in the secret basement of the Death House: a victorian-style mansion nestled in the village of Barovia, in the county of Barovia.

For those of you who witnessed this grisly event, you are living a nightmare. Two sad children starved to death, locked in the attic by their ghoulish parents... maybe it's better not to remember.

You carry Tinok's lifeless body through twisted earthen passages to a spiral staircase which climbs up to the fourth-story attic, then drag him further down three stories to the ground floor, then out into the blinding rain.

An impenetrable bank of fog once blanketed the village of Barovia, which has now been replaced by a torrential downpour of cold, piercing rain and hail.

A single, solitary vampire bat flaps away from the portico roof as soon as you exit the Death House with the corpse of Tinok.

Across the cobble-stoned street you see a blurry gray mass of wood and cloth. A spry old woman, soaked to the bone, struggles to pull a wooden pastry cart out of the slippery mud.
