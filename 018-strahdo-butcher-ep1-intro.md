Greetings fellow Maynards, and welcome to Strahdo Mojado, brought to you by Wet Maynard. Strahdo Mojado is our Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition Actual Play podcast and webcast, and never fear, it will be brought to you in English.

Why "Strahdo Mojado"? The name "Strahdo" comes from Count Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire lord and arch-villain of "Curse of Strahd", the adventure campaign which we will be playing, and "Mojado" is the Spanish word for "Wet". "Strahdo Mojado" therefore means "Wet Strahd," and since running water is one traditional method for killing vampires, there you have it.

For our opening session, we come to you from Butcher Bird Studios in beautiful Glendale California.
