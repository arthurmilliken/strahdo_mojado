I've been a registered Democrat my entire adult life, and while I recognize that there may be good cause for celebration, I am also deeply troubled by the counting irregularities and lack of transparency which occurred in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan during this election. I am also deeply troubled at how mainstream media has been covering (and covering up) news stories, and by the overt censorship being practiced by big tech monopolies.

As an American citizen, I want transparent and fair elections.

Win, lose or draw, I want confidence that American voices are being heard at the ballot box.

Why were poll watchers denied their legal right to observe counting? Why were hundreds of thousands of ballots dropped into these battleground states in the dead of night, after all observers and staff were told to go home, and how is it that these ballots broke in mathematically impossible proportions for one candidate?

Maybe it's nothing. Maybe there are perfectly reasonable, if not legal, explanations for these incidents.

Do you have no curiosity at all about these things? Do you have no concern that millions of American citizens might have been disenfranchised by this process? Is there no fear that next time, it may be YOUR vote that is overturned? Is winning at all costs so important that you are willing to sacrifice your most sacred right in this nation, the right to vote?

Is such a sacrifice really worth it, just to put Joe Biden into the White House?

May I ask a question? How has Joe Biden earned such loyalty? What has Joe Biden ever done for you?
