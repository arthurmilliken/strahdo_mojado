INTRO
------

The Village of Vallaki is really the central hub in Curse of Strahd. The narrative thrust of the adventure as written begins with a tightly focused quest to escort a damsel in distress to safety, then explodes into a spiderweb of possibilities once the heroes reach this fortified town.

Now that Anna and I had thoroughly dissected the hags of Old Bonegrinder, I felt the call of Vallaki. Though the night was getting long, and the probability that our heroes would spend much time in Vallaki during our next session was admittedly slim, I still took the opportunity to start laying the foundation for running this incredibly complex chapter.

Seeds must be planted and watered if they are to yield a bountiful harvest.

And goodnight to Gregoire Lourme who graciously made available through Creative Commons his memorable track, Memories, which you are listening to right now.

This is a Wet Maynard production.
