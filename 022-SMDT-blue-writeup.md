ACT I

Where is Hell? in Ravenloft, area K7, Entry. PCs move into the Great Entry (K8), where they meet Rahadin.

Rahadin leads the PCs south, towards the Dining Hall. Otto Belview attacks Rahadin, who had readied a Dodge action. He misses.

Clovin also attaks Rahadin, who descends into the Spiral Staircase (K21), taking an attack of opportunity from Otto.

PCs enter the Dining Hall (K10), where an illusion of Strahd plays the organ. Clovin immediately runs up to the organ and starts playing "Chopsticks", and Rictavio draws his sword cane and stabs at Strahd. Strahd, being an illusion, takes no damage from the attack, leaps into the air, and spiderclimbs through the ceiling.

The PCs climb up the spiral staircase (K21). After climbing one floor, Clovin casts *Locate Creature,* names Marzena Belview, and learns her location in the bedchamber (K42) on the 3rd floor. Clovin casts *Dimension Door* once to teleport to her room, then once more to teleport back to the stairwell with Marzena.

The PCs climb to the top of the spiral staircase (K21) to the Portrait of Strahd (K47) at the top of the stairwell. Rictavio is careful to avoid stepping over the Rug of Smothering and examines Strahd. The Portrait fails to cast *Crown of Madness* on Rictavio, and Rictavio slashes the portrait with a wooden stake. Otto leaps to Rictavio's defense, but the Rug of Smothering succeeds in an attack of opportunity and envelops Otto. Victor Villakovich casts *Bigby's Hand* to pick up the Rug and shake Otto free. Otto slashes the Rug apart with the Sunsword, Rictavio slashes the Portrait, and the Portrait uses *Telekinesis* to throw Rictavio down the stairs. Victor finishes off the Portrait with *Frostbolt*, and Otto casts *Rope Trick* to give the PCs a well-earned Short Rest.

The PCs discover the shaft below the trap door on the landing (K47), but decide against jumping down. Otto opens the door to the Lounge (K49), where they find Ismark the Former, turned into a Vampire Spawn. Otto closes the door so that the PCs can plan their attack, and when he opens it again, Ismark has disappeared. Clovin rushes into the room, opens a window, and casts a *Minor Illusion* of Rictavio sticking his head out the window. This is enough to trigger Ismark's readied attack, who was clinging to the wall outside the window. Victor casts *Evard's Black Tentacles* near the window, and Ismark after making his saving throw slinks away.

ACT II

Clovin searches the Lounge (K49), admiring leaded windows and skimming through *Goats of the Balinok Mountains*. The PCs leave the Lounge, and climb the spiral staircase up to the Tower Roof (K57).

Marzena flies to the High Tower Peak (K59), and ties ropes to the arrow slits so that the PCs can scale the High Tower walls, dropping into the High Tower through the gap in the roof. Rictavio lights a torch and drops it down the tower shaft (K18a).

Pidlwick II drops from the rafters, along with eight crawling claws. Clovin picks up Pidlwick II and drops him down the shaft, while the others dispatch the crawling claws. After gazing down the long shaft, the PCs decide to scale back down the tower walls to the Tower Roof (K57) below.

The PCs bravely cross the windy bridge leading to the North Tower, bringing them to the beating Heart of Sorrow (K20). Clovin assails the Heart with *Vicious Mockery*, followed by Victor's *Cone of Cold*, freezing and shattering the Heart. Ten animated halberds swoop in to attack, and the PCs fend them off over the next few rounds of combat, courtesy of Rictavio's *Word of Radiance* and Otto's Sunsword.

Clovin continues his *Vicious Mockery* of Ravenloft's flavor text, and our studio audience taunts the PCs into splitting up the party. Clovin and Rictavio head towards the High Tower, and Marzena flies to the High Tower roof to set rope for them.

Otto carries Victor up the stairs of the North Tower to its peak (K60). They find a locked chest and are unable to open it. Otto climbs the ladder to the North Tower rooftop (K60a). When bats swarm the tower roof, Otto climbs back down and closes the trapdoor behind him. Otto takes the locked chest, and Victor casts *Levitate* on Otto and jumps on his back. Both float down the north tower shaft, and are engulfed by a thick mist before reaching the bottom.

Meanwhile, Clovin and Rictavio climb to the High Tower Peak (K59), using the rope lowered by Marzena. Clovin requests Little Richard's "Long Tall Sally" from the DJ. Clovin casts *Feather Fall* and down the shaft goes he and Rictavio, with Marzena flapping alongside. They are engulfed by a thick mist before reaching the bottom.

When the thick mist disperses, all characters are standing together in Strahd's Audience Hall (K25). Strahd von Zarovich rises from his throne and greets the player characters.

Otto taunts Strahd. Clovin taunts Strahd. The livestream audience taunts Strahd. Victor taunts Strahd. Victor continues to taunt Strahd.
