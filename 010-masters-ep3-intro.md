Hi, and welcome back to Masters of the D, our behind-the-scenes Dungeon Masters workshop for our Strahdo Mojado campaign. I'm Arthur Milliken.

When we last met, Anna and I had just finished preparing to run the introductory scenario of Curse of Strahd, called "Death House", and our episode concluded just as our players began to arrive for our first session, where we recorded Strahdo Mojado chapter 1, entitled "Tinok et Ohr".

If you haven't yet listened to the first chapter of Strahdo Mojado, I urge you to do so now. Go ahead, hit the stop button, and go listen to that chapter. Pay close attention to the thrilling climax where minwin's character, Tinok et Ohr, commits himself to a course of action which sets the course for the rest of the campaign.

Today, we will pick up after the conclusion of chapter 1, but before our recording of chapter 2, called "Meat Pies". My co-Dungeon Master, Anna Wenger, and I, review that first session while planning our next.

Because we launched Strahdo Mojado right in the middle of the action without taking any time to set the stage, now is the time for us to zoom out and establish who our heroes are, where did they come from and why are they participating in this adventure?

If you haven't yet listened to or to watched Strahdo Mojado chapter 2, "Meat Pies", now would be a great time to do so, because Anna and I will be discussing plans which may spoil some of the surprises which happen in Strahdo Mojado. Go ahead and hit pause now and we'll see you when you return. However, if you are more of the behind-the-scenes type who wants to experience Strahdo Mojado purely from the DM's point of view, then that is entirely up to you.

So, how did it go? Listen and find out. This is a Wet Maynard Production.
