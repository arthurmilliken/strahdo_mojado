I've been a registered Democrat my entire adult life, and while I recognize that there may be good cause for celebration, I am also deeply troubled by the counting irregularities and lack of transparency which occurred in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan during this election. I am also deeply troubled at how mainstream media has been covering (and covering up) news stories, and by the overt censorship being practiced by big tech monopolies.

As an American citizen, I want transparent and fair elections.

Win, lose or draw, I want confidence that American voices are being heard at the ballot box.

Why were poll watchers denied their legal right to observe counting? Why were hundreds of thousands of ballots dropped into these battleground states in the dead of night, after all observers and staff were told to go home, and how is it that these ballots broke in mathematically impossible proportions for one candidate?

Maybe it's nothing. Maybe there are perfectly reasonable, if not legal, explanations for these incidents.

Do you have no curiosity at all about these things? Do you have no concern that millions of American citizens might have been disenfranchised by this process? Is there no fear that next time, it may be YOUR vote that is overturned? Is winning at all costs so important that you are willing to sacrifice your most sacred right in this nation, the right to vote?

Is such a sacrifice really worth it, just to put Joe Biden into the White House?

May I ask a question? How has Joe Biden earned such loyalty? What has Joe Biden ever done for you?

I waited three years with baited breath for all of the "credible" mainstream media sources to be vindicated by Robert Mueller, when he would finally prove once and for all that the Trump Administration had successfully colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. My hopes were dashed when all of the "credible" mainstream media sources were proven wrong. What about all of the "credible" mainstream election polling data from 2016 and 2020? The "credible" Washington Post reported Wisconsin was +17%(!!!) for Joe Biden one week before November 3rd. Really??

When 90% of all media outlets are owned by six (that's it: six!) corporate conglomerates, we no longer have a free press. All we have is an echo chamber. Yes, I hear the same echoing drumbeat: "no evidence of fraud", and "mail-in ballots are perfectly secure" from the same echo chamber we are all hearing it from. I see the same contextual "fact-checking" labels being used to shame and silence dissenting voices, including the President of the United States of America. Is anyone from the mainstream media even attempting to investigate allegations of voter fraud, or are they simply echoing the same talking point of "no evidence" "baseless claims" "no evidence" "baseless claims"? Twitter, Facebook and Google/YouTube are doing everything in their power to prevent evidence from ever seeing the light of day, but they are failing in their endeavor. When I take the effort to peel back the curtain, I begin to see a very different narrative than the one being pushed by the mainstream media. The information is freely available, for anyone who has enough curiosity to LOOK.

How easy it is to smear a publication by labeling it as "right-wing" and expecting everyone to respond with "oh, gee, if they're 'right-wing' then obviously they must be lying!" Fine. All you need to do, then, is track the lawsuits. Do you really think all of these lawsuits are frivolous? Why would the Trump Administration (or any organization, for that matter) waste so much precious resources on efforts which are 100% doomed to failure? What outcome do you imagine they are hoping to achieve? Do you honestly believe they are that deranged? Or might it be possible that the "derangement" is coming from somewhere else?
