Hi, and welcome to Strahdo Mojado chapter 2, entitled "Meat Pies." For this next chapter, Wet Maynard was blessed to have the opportunity to record our session with Butcher Bird Studios in beautiful Glendale, California, and I want to take a moment to thank Butcher Bird studios, and of course my long-time friend Luis Reyes, as well as Travis Stevens and the whole Butcher Bird crew for providing such an outstanding experience. These folks are simply amazing. Butcher Bird Studios is a creative media company, combining their expertise in narrative, branding and design with a full-service production & post studio to become your turn-key creative solution for a wide range of media projects. You can check out their portfolio at butcherbirdstudios.com.

We pick up our story after the thrilling conclusion of Chapter 1, where Tinok et Ohr, human cleric of Jesus Christ, committed himself to a course of action which will set the course for the rest of the campaign. I won't spoil the ending here, just in case you haven't listened to it yet, but make sure you listen to that first chapter before continuing on here.

It is now time for our heroes to explore the village of Barovia, while dealing with the consequences of Tinok's choice. It is also time for us as an audience to explore our heroes. Who exactly are these people who have stumbled into the fog-choked county of Barovia? And why exactly are they here? And where exactly did they come from? And how exactly do they end the Curse of Strahd which has blighted the land for centuries? Learn all this and more as we begin Strahdo Mojado Chapter 2: Meat Pies.
