INTRO
------

Hi, and welcome back to Masters of the D. Last session, our heroes learned that their destiny was to kill the dread vampire lord Strahd von Zarovich, who has been a blight over the dreary land of Barovia for centuries.

A gifted fortune-teller named Madam Eva revealed three magical artifacts and a potential ally who could assist our heroes in defeating Strahd and ending his curse over the land. The first of these artifacts, the Holy Crucifix of Ravenkind, was found buried in a grave at the "Crossroads of Life and Death". The second artifact, called the Tome of Strahd, lies within "a lonely mill on a precipice."

That windmill, Old Bonegrinder, is home to a powerful coven of Night Hags, who won't take very kindly to a band of looters kicking down their front door.

Well don't consider it done just yet. We have one thank you for Gregoire Lourme for his sleepless track "Insomnia," which you are listening to right now. This has been a Wet Maynard production.
