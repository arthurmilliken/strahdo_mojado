Hi, and welcome to Strahdo Mojado. In our last episode, we took a few moments to reflect upon the identity of our heroes and what brought them to Barovia. Two clerics walk into a bar, both of them followers of Jesus Christ. They were greeted by a mysterious visitor who handed them a letter, a plea for help written by the burgomaster of Barovia. Meanwhile, two other unlikely friends, a stately wizard-woman whose magic had gone awry and a lost forest gnome missing her tribe of Snarfs, discovered another letter, a warning written by the same burgomaster of Barovia.

Two different letters, with two different intentions. Perhaps Ismark the Lesser can be of assistance.
