Hi, and welcome to our next episode of Masters of the D, where Anna and I finish our planning for the opening chapter of Strahdo Mojado. Here, our conversation veers into personal territory as both Anna and I contemplate the role D&D -- and God -- has played in our own lives. We then fast-forward to the big day itself and our last-minute DM preparations before our heroes arrive on the scene. In our next episode, we will continue our play-through with Strahdo Mojado chapter 2.
