Hi, and welcome to Strahdo Mojado, a Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition Actual Play podcast, brought to you by Wet Maynard Productions. For today's adventure, we will be playing the published campaign Curse of Strahd, written by Chris Perkins.

Around our table, we have:

- Minh Nguyen playing Tinok, a human cleric of Jesus Christ,
- Nathan Johnson playing K'K'Ken, a dragonborn, also a cleric, and also a follower of Jesus Christ.
- Carrisa Knight Montenegro playing Lisbet Nightshade, a human Wizard with a knack for home decorating.
- Shawn Mason playing Dronk, a half-orc bongo-wielding Bard.
- And Matt M playing Buffy, a half-elf Paladin who looks exactly like ... well you'll have to listen and see!
- I'm Arthur Milliken, and I will be your Dungeon Master today.

But wait, there's more! We also have a *second* DM! Her name is Anna Wenger.

But enough introducing. Let's get straight to maynarding.
