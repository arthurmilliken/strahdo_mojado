Hello, and welcome to a special edition of Strahdo Mojado and Masters of the D, brought to you by Wet Maynard Productions in conjunction with Butcher Bird Studios here in beautiful Glendale California!

Strahdo Mojado is our Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition Actual Play podcast and now live stream, while Masters of the D is Wet Maynard Productions' exclusive Dungeon Mastering workshop where we reveal the dark and twisted schemes of our DMs as we prepare for our upcoming game!

I'm Arthur Milliken, and today we have some very special programming planned for you. In one hour, at three o'clock, we will begin a five-hour session of Strahdo Mojado, where we will be playing the published adventure Curse of Strahd, written by Chris Perkins. That session will end at 8pm Pacific Standard Time.

However, during the next hour, the lovely Anna Wenger, seated across from me, and I, who together have decided to partner as co-DMs for Strahdo Mojado, will be planning that session in front of all of you. Will our dastardly plans succeed? Stick around and find out. Let's get started. Hi, Anna!
