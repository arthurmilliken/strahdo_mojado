"Creo Ignem."

Clovin Belview pondered the meaning of these words, barked by a thin young wizard perched upon a stool, who pointed a long index finger at Clovin. A streak of flame bolted into Clovin's chest, and his entire body exploded in a great ball of flame. Clovin cried out in pain, while his second, infant head only hissed in agony. The flames spread quickly, lighting the dusty rug under his feet within seconds. He considered for a moment the sins of his recent life, withholding food from his starving brethren who were locked in dank cells in the Abbey of Saint Markovia. Clovin could then feel his hair catching fire around his stubby goat horns as his vision blurred and faded to black.

Victor Vallakovich largely ignored the writhing corpse of this two-headed mongrel monstrosity, and instead approached the scaly dragon-kin body lying next to him. Victor had heard stories about a dragon-born again Christian who had disintegrated a half-dozen vampire spawn in a ball of radiant sunlight out on the Old Svalich road outside of Vallaki. Surely such a feat must have been performed with the aid of a powerful Christian artifact, perhaps the Holy Crucifix of Ravenkind itself.

Victor quickly tore apart the dead dragonborn's robes, ignoring the rapidly spreading flames around him, until he felt in his hands a cold metal pendant. He looked down, and saw it: a golden cross with a sunburst pattern in the center, upon which was mounted a platinum image of Jesus, suffering. Victor gasped, and his lungs burned with hot smoke. He had found his prize, but as the flames mounted around him, he realized too late there was no way to escape the inferno around him.

Outside, Rudolph van Richten, the old vampire hunter himself, adjusted his rose-colored spectacles and flopped his cloth cap back on the top of his balding skull. Immediately his body transformed into the youthful half-elf figure of Rictavio, a well-known mountebank and proprietor of Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders. It was in this disguise as Rictavio that the old vampire hunter entered the burning mansion of Baron Vallakovich. The flames originated above the third floor, and that was most likely where he would find the Holy Crucifix of Ravenkind.

When Rictavio finally reached the attic, the raging fire was too hot and too violent to survive. No matter. This was a one-way passage. Rictavio picked his way over the charred corpses of Lady Vallakovich, Ilya Krezkov, Ken the Dragonborn and the pitiful mongrel form of Clovin Belview, to find his prize: Victor Vallakovich the young wizard, clutching the golden crucifix in his charred hands as his robes and hair smoldered, and his flesh cooked in the heat of the flames.

Rictavio's death would come next, and he welcomes it. He would have the Crucifix in hand as he screams his last breath in burning agony and gets dragged directly into Hell, where he could confront the devil himself, Strahd von Zarovich, Vampire Lord of Barovia.

And where exactly is Hell? Perched in the craggy foothills of Mount Baratok, in the county of Barovia, a gothic fortress called Castle Ravenloft. Overwhelming. Overpowering. The eye could not take it all in at first. The curtain wall nearly fifty feet high, interrupted by squared-off turrets that rose even higher. As massive as these are, they are made small by the round towers of the keep, the tallest soaring three times the height of the curtain wall. A drawbridge spans a chasm a thousand feet deep.

Within the front courtyard, Rictavio, you discover that you are not alone in your condemnation to Hell. It seems that Clovin Belview and Victor Vallakovich were sinners as well, for the three of you stand together within the walls of Castle Ravenloft.

Thick, cold fog swirls in this front courtyard. Sporadic flashes of lightning lance the weeping clouds overhead as thunder shakes the ground. Through the drizzle, you see torch flames fluttering on each side of the keep’s open main doors. Warm light spills out of the entrance, flooding the courtyard. High above the entrance is a round window with shards of broken glass lodged in its iron frame.

The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors.

The doors in front of you suddenly swing open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music.

A squat figure stands inside the hall. He looks like a beardless dwarf with patches of donkey flesh covering his face and body. He has one human ear and one wolf’s ear, and a protruding wolf’s snout and fangs. His arms and hands are human, but his legs and feet are leonine, and he has a donkey’s tail.

Clovin, you immediately recognize your cousin Otto Belview.

Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight.
