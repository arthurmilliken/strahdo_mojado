LISBET NIGHTSHADE tastes the bitter juice of GOOD-BERRIES, as they are forced into her mouth by the dirty hands of wild pagans. Bound head to toe in black vines, she lies helpless as they chant WINTER-SPLINTER-WINTER-SPLINTER, carrying her overhead in a funeral procession up the muddy slopes of YESTER-HILL

A single eye peers through a crack in the ropy vines: a towering, lumbering TREE-BLIGHT, and the midday sky black as night, blanketed by the flapping wings of a thousand shrieking ravens...

DOOOOM-DOOM-DOOM-DOOOOM: The darkness... gives you comfort, along with the stretched human skin, pulled taut across the top of your bongo drum... DOOM-DOOM-DOOOOM - taken from the corpse of your grandfather, who demanded you take his life in the field of battle. It was your honor to plunge your war-knife into his heart.

DOOOOM-DOOM-DOOOOM-DOOOOM-DOOOOM - the darkness... is ripped away by a lightning flash, exploding from a black-grey sky.

You are sitting on a wet wooden bench atop a colorful carnival wagon. Two hulking draft horses stand hitched to the yoke. Two additional draft horses stand tied to a dark pine tree nearby.

A flock of ravens swarms overhead, circling and squawking, followed by an enormous black man-raven, clucthing what looks like a small blue-skinned girl in a backpack and carrying a bloody spear twice her size.

As the man-raven lowers himself, the blue-skinned girl's blue eyes lock into yours. “Long have I waited,” you whisper fiercely, “for one who is worthy. My spear hungers for blood. Retrieve it, and rule these mountains in my stead, just like the mighty warriors from the early days of the Whispering Wall.”

She aims the spear toward your face, and hurls it with a deep fury. The spear lodges into the wagon, inches from your head.
