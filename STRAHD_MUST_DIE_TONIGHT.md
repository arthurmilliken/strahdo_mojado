### Discord chat

What does it mean that games must take place over discord? What if we want to stream over Twitch/YouTube?
And I thought Roll20 had its own chat interface for handling dice rolling, etc?

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:16 PM
Streaming is allowed and encouraged! Discord is the suggested platform for voice communication

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:16 PM
it does, and you can use that!

LtBardolphToday at 12:17 PM
What if my group already has tech for voice communication and video mixing? We use vMix, but can easily stream to streaming platforms
Do we have to route all of our audio into Discord if we already have means to communicate?

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:17 PM
yup, that's fine, no need to use Discord in that case

LtBardolphToday at 12:18 PM
Sorry for so many questions, I'm trying to grok the format. So, once we register, do all games/schedules/channels get published somewhere before we start?

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:20 PM
Not all people will be streaming, so if you want to publicize your stream, you can do so in the subreddit, using the 'broadcast' flair and in this discord using #shameless-self-promotion
But yeah, that's effectively up to you

LtBardolphToday at 12:21 PM
So, the idea is that all the groups play their games (streaming or offline), then publish their game write-ups and comm recordings to the subreddit?

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:21 PM
exactly, yup

LtBardolphToday at 12:21 PM
What is the purpose of registering?

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:22 PM
a) for awarding the flair prizes
b) sending the maps/games if you don't have yours set up

LtBardolphToday at 12:23 PM
Ah, I see.
So, if we are not vying for a flair prize and we already have the maps, then there's no need to register?
Meaning if we aren't  one of the following: (1) No spellcasters in the party, (2) No melee characters in the party, (3) No Cleric and No Paladin in your party and (4) Everyone in your party is a pre-generated legacy character from last year.

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:25 PM
there's still participation flairs
like last year

LtBardolphToday at 12:26 PM
I wasn't around last year, so I have no idea what's going on :slight_smile:
I don't even know what a "flair" is

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:28 PM
haha, fair, it's like a tag next to your name on reddit when you post to the subreddit. If you're not interested, you don't have to register, but it would help the mods to know how many groups are participating this year :))

LtBardolphToday at 12:29 PM
I'd love to register, just to let people know what we're up to. But most of my players don't have discord/reddit accounts. Do I need every one of them to register before we can submit our group?

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:30 PM
no, that's fine, just leave a note in the registration form that you don't need anything and explaining your situation!

LtBardolphToday at 12:30 PM
Aha I got it. Sounds great. Thanks for indulging my ignorance :wink:

Ziopliukas (He/Him)Today at 12:31 PM
no worries!


### My notes on running Strahd like an Unholy Terror.

#### GUIDE

There's a better than average chance that I'm a little bit evil. My players know this, and they love/hate me for it. In the interest of spreading the terror, I thought I'd share my notes on how I'm running Strahd in my game. This is filtered through my perspective on Strahd as a character, so I'll drop my notes on that first.

Disclaimer: I'm wordy. This is long.

##### Overview

Strahd is smart.

Strahd's combat tactics should adapt to the players. He should figure out the party's weaknesses and target them explicitly. For example, a party with lots of single-target damage but little AoE capabilities will struggle with large hosts of weak enemies.

Strahd has long-since figured out that something is sabotaging his efforts to get Tatyana. This is why he doesn't just punch the party's teeth in and snatch her the moment they walk away from Barovia Town. "Grab her and turn her into a vampire" hasn't worked in 700 years, the PCs (as a wildcard not native to Barovia) present an opportunity to try more creative solutions.

Strahd is extremely well-informed. Between his spies, ability to Scry, and ability to Charm people for information, it should be rare that he is unaware of something.

Strahd should not make stupid mistakes. If he ever lays hands on the Villain Ball, I have done something wrong.

Strahd is a General

Strahd's tactical acumen applies to any monsters he is commanding. The party should be able to tell when Strahd is directly in charge of enemies they are fighting because they will be drawn into ambushes and kill-boxes, be outflanked regularly, and have to deal with enemies targeting squishy party members first.

Strahd is very familiar with mixed-unit tactics and should use them. Look for tactical synergy between monsters under his control and exploit it. For example: zombie meat-shields backed up by skeleton archers and/or using wolves to run down the PCs and knock them Prone so slower units (like Vampire Spawn or Zombies) can catch up.

Strahd is familiar with the effectiveness of Magic as tactical support. The party should encounter Strahd-commanded monsters that have been magically buffed by spellcasters who didn't stick around for the actual fight

Strahd is familiar with the role of terrain in combat. The party should never have a terrain-based advantage when fighting Strahd-commanded forces, and Strahd should bring units well-suited to the environment. For example, if Strahd has the druids throw a horde of Blights at the party, they should attack on open terrain with no choke-points. In terrain with significant elevation differences, archers should be positioned on high-ground

Strahd is a wizard with access to every single spell in the game

If there's a 5th level or lower spell in the books that looks useful to Strahd, he has access to it.

Strahd has absurd Ambush capabilities

He has the home-field advantage. He may have nests of monsters hidden all over the valley (like the Vampire Spawn in the coffin-maker's attic) that he can deploy. He has also had centuries to familiarize himself with the terrain to pick out good spots for an ambush. It's entirely possible for him to have minions he hid so long ago that all traces of their hiding place are gone (such as burying Zombies somewhere long enough ago that grass grew over their hidey hole).

He, personally, has absurd stealth capabilities between a very high Stealth check and the ability to go Invisible

Beucephalus allows him and his minions to travel via the Ethereal Plane...which is almost entirely imperceptible and completely intangible to people on the Material Plane and lets them ignore pesky things like walls. Bear in mind that Beucephalus can only move 3 willing creatures back and forth at a time. (Note: 'Charmed' can quickly become 'Willing.')

Strahd is Bored

With all the advantages Strahd has, if he wanted the party dead...they'd be dead. But, Strahd has been living in Barovia for centuries and there's nothing native to the valley that actually threatens him. Adventurers are a rare opportunity for him to find some entertainment. Strahd's entertainment primarily consists of terrorizing people and corrupting 'good' things. This all manifests in a few ways...

Strahd is not actually bothered when his plans don't work. Instead, he's impressed because it's something novel. He may congratulate the party on their accomplishment.

Strahd's plans are not always about achieving a tangible objective. For example, the Feast of St. Andrals is not some rare opportunity to get rid of a thorn in his side. If he really wanted the bones gone, they'd have been gone ages ago. He has lots of minions that are unaffected by holy ground (like cultists, druids, and werewolves) who could steal them and dispose of them much more thoroughly than hiding them in some old dude's closet. Rather, the plan was more about Henrik, Milivoj, and Yeska. Three people who don't serve Strahd that were manipulated into doing something that put the lives of a large number of people in danger and almost destroyed the one 'safe place' in the valley. Even leaving the bones in Henrik's closet was deliberately aimed to taunt him with the fact of "You could fix this at any time, but you are too cowardly to risk it." And they get to deal with the knowledge of what they did for the rest of their lives.

Cities provide no actual protection from Strahd. None of them are actually capable of defending themselves against him and his forces. They continue to exist because he wants them to. After all, it's a lot more convenient when your food-stock takes care of itself and tends to its own pens. If Strahd decides a city needs to go, it's history. (The half-dozen Vampire Spawn that Strahd dropped in the coffin-maker's shop could, most likely, take out the entire guard force by themselves. 24 guards and a pallisade really isn't much in the way of viable defenses against a Vampire Lord.)

Strahd is trying to draw things out. Until the party reaches the 'too dangerous to let live' stage, he won't actively try to kill PCs. If they just happen to die, then oh well, guess they weren't going to be interesting anyway.

Strahd's campaign against the PCs should be psychological warfare heavy.

Strahd is a Prisoner

For all his power, for all his might...Strahd is a prisoner in the lands of Barovia. With his permission, anyone can safely leave Barovia--except for him. He is both Lord of Barovia, and the inmate that can never leave.

Strahd has an ancient agreement with the Vistani, giving them free passage through his lands. In exchange, they act as informants for him. (Some Vistani serve him directly, but this is not the norm.) This is how he gets news from the outside if he is interested.

Strahd is aware that something more powerful than him is toying with him, and is trying to find a way to break their grip on him.

Strahd Is The Land

Strahd has an intrinsic tie to Barovia, this has a few effects.

Weather conditions conspire to favor Strahd. This can mean anything from him getting Dramatic Cracks of Thunder whenever he wants them, to having a heavy rain or fog obscuring sight and sound when he wants to be sneaky, to just making people he doesn't like miserable.

On a grand scale, Strahd can alter the environment. Historically, he used this power to destroy the town of Berez by flooding it and permanently turning it into a swamp. This is part of why you cannot successfully defend a town that Strahd wants to destroy...he can turn the environment against it. (Flood Vallaki, take Krezk out with an avalanche, etc)

Strahd technically owns everything in the entire valley; he does not need an invitation to enter a home. This is a trump card for him, though--and not something he reveals lightly. Also, he still maintains some noble sensibilities--it's rude to just barge into someone's home without an invitation.

Creative Tactics

Because of Strahd's capabilities, he has tactical options not available to your average enemy...particularly when he is acting as a commander.

Fun and Games with Beucephalus

Beucephalus, despite getting only an extremely minor mention in the book, is incredibly useful...as such, I upgraded him a bit in my game. Strahd put forth the effort to acquire Barding for the horse, upping its AC to 18. So, given this, lets look at some options...

Strahd is faster than you: With a mount that flies at 90', Strahd is the fastest moving thing in the valley apart from the Rok. He can easily beat the party to any location he wants to beat them to.

Perfect Infiltration: Beucephalus can transport Strahd and/or several minions via the Ethereal Plane into otherwise-impossible-to-access locations and drop them off. It is impossible for them to be seen coming.

Perfect Ambush: Can move allied creatures into an ambush location, then they all Ready Actions to attack the moment the are shifted to the Material.

Tactical repositioning: Beucephalus can pull allies into the Ethereal, relocate them, then pop back into the Material with them on the next round. This allows him to move allied creatures past choke points, barricades, and other obstacles. This can be paired with the 'Perfect Ambush' option to dogpile a vulnerable character.

It's raining monsters: This takes some prep-work, but Beucephalus can be used to lead a parade of creatures through the Ethereal to points near the PCs. Beucephalus then goes from point to point, popping these monsters back to the Material Plane, delivering a moderate force to a location without any sign of their approach. Easily usable to fill houses with monsters to all come pouring out to attack the PCs once the time is right. For a bit of hilarity, make this literal. The monsters all stand above the combat point, and Beucephalus starts transporting them back to the Material, allowing them to literally rain down on the PCs.

Using Beucephalus is not without risks. If he is destroyed then any creatures presently on the Ethereal are stranded there. This is another good reason for Strahd to have devil-summoning spells, as he may get stranded on the Ethereal and need to temporarily summon up another Nightmare to get himself out. An alternative possibility is to make it that Beucephalus cannot be properly killed...if killed, Strahd can resummon it in 24 hours. Pulling in a magic item from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (Infernal Tack) could be used with this--if you want to get rid of Beucephalus, you need to get the spurs that summon him and bind him to Strahd. Without them, he can't summon the Nightmare (and if you're evil...maybe now you can).

Confusion Tactics

If Strahd gets to prepare the battlefield, perhaps he sets some things up in advance.

Illusory Terrain to hide natural or unnatural (like pit traps) perils

Cast Seeming to disguise creatures as something they aren't. This could be anything from making monsters look like normal people, to making them look like other sorts of monster. Ghouls disguised as Zombies, Skeletons disguised as Vampire Spawn (see how fast the PCs run). Disguising a mob of undead as a mob of bandits may trick the party's divine casters into not attempting to Turn them...or vice versa, getting the divine caster to waste an Action trying to Turn humanoids.

Illusory body doubles. Illusion spells can be used to make a minion look like him, or himself look like one of his minions. As a 'cheating to get out of defeat free' aside...in the event that your PCs get off a bunch of lucky crits and 'lay Strahd out,' you could always retroactively decide that they took out a illusion-cloaked body double, not the real thing. Or use it for a bait and switch...throw a Vampire Spawn magicked to look like Strahd at them and let them kill it. While the PCs stand there going 'wtf, that was it?' the real thing pops up and flattens the party.

Employ the use of bait--fake and legitimate. Charm, Suggest, or Force random innocents into positions that will draw the PCs into a trap. Or polymorph a monster into looking like an innocent for the same purposes.

Playing with Charm

A vampire's charm is very powerful, but has its limits. While you see Strahd as your dear friend and are incapable of trying to do him harm--it doesn't mean you aren't still friends with the other PCs. If he's going to Charm you into betraying your friends, he has to make them not your friends first. However, Strahd does not have to be in humanoid form to use Charm. Charming people as a bat is perfectly functional.

Charm the bearer of the Sunsword. Politely ask them to turn it off, as it is hurting him. Then, unleash some sob-story about how that sword belonged to his dearly beloved brother and he has been looking for it for ages and oh wouldn't the PC let him return the sword to his brother's grave. It would give him so much closure to have finally recovered the last of his brother's most precious belongings. (Note: Nothing said in that statement is a lie as long as Strahd takes the sword back to his brother's grave before trying to destroy it.)

Pre-Charm some PCs before a fight breaks out. Enjoy the chaos as members of the party are trying to break up the fight rather than trying to kill him.

Charm a PC then use Sending or Rary's Telepathic Bond to send them secret messages and instructions.

Have conversations with Charmed PCs. Plant ideas in their heads that their other 'friends' don't appreciate them. Or that they don't trust them.

Remember that Charm works on NPCs, too. He can Charm an otherwise neutral NPC into trying to break up a fight or fighting on his side so the PCs end up either killing an innocent person, or being paranoid about whether or not any humanoid they are fighting against is actually doing it of their own will and always going for non-lethal. Couple this with Illusions for extra chaos.

Making Strahd seem omniscient (without cheating)

One of the scariest things about Strahd, in my mind, is when the players start to believe he is all-knowing. When they start to believe that he truly is the land, and that they can't hide their actions from him. In truth, Strahd is not all-knowing--but he likes people to think he is. While it is fully possible to just cheat and make Strahd know things, I find it more fun to look at how he can actually seem omniscient

Use Detect Thoughts to have Strahd finish people's sentences for them. Or have him ask them questions, then he vocalizes the answer to that question if they don't respond.

Pair Charm with Modify Memory to interview characters (PCs and NPCs) without their knowledge. Strahd Charms them, asks them questions for less than 10 minutes, then wipes the event from their memory. He could gain some extremely personal information about PCs this way.

Spies. Spies everywhere. They don't even have to be malicious or even all that active--they don't need to follow the players around or act suspicious. They might just be some rando Barovian that got an unpleasant visit and offered something (even if that something was "I won't feed you to my wolves") in exchange for reporting anything they happen to learn about Outsiders. Most Barovians are flatly terrified of Strahd--it wouldn't be hard at all for him to press some into service for little things like that.

When scrying, choose your targets cleverly. If the PCs are hanging out with someone who serves Strahd, target that person (as they'll auto-fail voluntarily). If your party travels with animals (like horses), target them instead of a PC. It's a lot easier to get hair from the party's horse while it's in a stable than it is to get hair from a PC. Still, try to get a lock of hair (or other sheddable body-part, like scales) from each PC. If the PCs all go down in a fight...perhaps rather than making it a TPK, they all wake up with missing bits of hair.

Spies on the Ethereal Plane. Strahd has Beucephalus pop a minion onto the Ethereal Plane and has them follow the party around for a while. Perhaps he always has a spy camping them from the Ethereal, and they just rotate out to go back and report to him.

Moles. The book tends to call out that humanoids allied to Strahd are pretty open about their allegiance. This is dumb. Sure, maybe some of them are all rah-rah-Strahd-forever! But some are certainly aware that they can better serve their master if their allegiance is secret. Have individuals who are servants of Strahd be friendly--have them lie about their allegiance (or tell an 'exact words' falsehood where the words they say are technically true, but intended to mislead). Do stuff that aids the PCs but doesn't hamper Strahd (much). Then they can happily report to Strahd all the information that the PCs freely give them, because they trust them now. In my game, I did this with the Vistani near Vallaki. The PCs like them and quite trust Luvash (finding him to be a very entertaining character because he's this massive thug-looking guy who is obviously wrapped around his daughter's finger) to the point of letting him sneak them into Vallaki and watch their horse while they are in there. Naturally, Luvash has acquired some horse-hair for his master's scrying spells at this point.

Effects of this

If the party comes up with some sort of pass-phrase or sign to prove it's really them, check to see if they are being observed when they decide on it. If so, Strahd now knows the 'trick' they came up with to confirm their identity.

Strahd is not surprised by plans or tricks that the players come up with. If they sit around working out a strategy for fighting him, he knows what their plan is. In fact, he may develop plans specifically to counter them.

If a planned deception was discussed out loud by the PCs, Strahd knows about it. The only way to have a real chance at deceiving him is to do it off-the-cuff, or at least never discuss it out loud.

There are countermeasures to this, but your players will have to figure them out...if they realize what's happening in the first place.

Stages of Interest

In my game, I gauge Strahd's current interest in the party in 5 levels. The more attention Strahd is paying to you, the more dangerous your life becomes.

Stage 1: Aware

The party has only recently arrived in Barovia and hasn't done anything of note yet. Strahd is aware that they exist because he is aware of anyone who enters his domain, but isn't paying much attention to them. Basically, they need to prove they aren't just going to bite it the first time a couple zombies jump them before he's going to bother paying attention. At this point...

Strahd continues business as normal. If the party encounters him at this point, it's coincidental--he was somewhere doing something, and they just happened to be there at the same time. The Feast of St. Andrals is an example of such a potential encounter.

Vistani and other allies of Strahd will report to him anything they learn about the PCs, but Strahd is making no special effort to investigate them.

If they encounter creatures Strahd controls, he is not commanding them.

Stage 2: Interested

The party has performed some unexpected or impressive feat (thwarting a plan, killing a powerful creature, acquiring a relic, etc.) and Strahd has deemed them worth his attention. At this point, he is primarily gathering information.

Spies start trying to steal a personal effect or bit of hair from the PCs to boost the efficacy of Strahd's Scrying spell. Randomly call for Wisdom saves from the party to represent his attempts to scry on them (definitely don't tell them why they are saving).

If a PC is isolated at some point, Strahd may attempt to interview them. He approaches them in bat form and tries to Charm them. If successful, he takes humanoid form and has a chat. He wants to know more about them and their companions, and asks questions to that effect. He keeps the interview short, then tries to use Modify Memory to wipe the conversation from the PC's head. In play, simply call for Wisdom Saves from the isolated player and don't tell anyone anything if they fail both (perhaps tell the player outside of the game if you want to let them RP out their (forgotten) discussion with Strahd. Strahd can use the same trick on NPCs that the party is friendly with.

Strahd will observe the party in combat while invisible/ethereal/as a bat/etc. He may throw a mixed or buffed unit at them and command it, just to see how they fare.

This is when Strahd sends them the invitation to dinner. I recommend having a look at elven tower's guide on Dinner with Strahd, as it is much better than what's in the book.

If you plan to plant a Strahd-serving mole in the party, now's the time.

Stage 3: Active Interference

Strahd has gathered enough information, and now it's time to have fun. This is the stage that Strahd will be in for most of the adventure. He is seeking to corrupt the PCs, manipulate them into helping him bypass whatever it is that is keeping him from Ireena, break their spirits, or whatever else he deems suitable for a given PC. This will be broken up into two parts...

Changes to life for the party

Enemies should behave more intelligently and mixed units should start becoming more common. However, more intelligent creatures may intentionally leave downed creatures alive (deal non-lethal KO damage), because Strahd isn't done with them yet

Strahd himself may pick fights with them, just to kick them around a bit. Always have multiple escape plans in mind.

Strahd's pyschological warfare goals are primarily focused on sowing distrust and paranoia among the PCs. If a particular PC seems susceptible to betraying their friends, he focuses on isolating that character. Additionally, if he can get them to do something 'evil' then points to him.

Example ideas for ways Strahd may interact

Strahd gives the party a quest. The quest is to do something that is objectively good (such as saving children from Old Bonegrinder/Werewolves or restoring the winery). He doesn't really care if they succeed or not, he just wants to see what they'll do. Do they refuse the quest because of its source? Are they second-guessing themselves the whole way? Do they do the opposite of what he asked them to do?

Strahd continues information gathering. If he catches a PC or allied NPC alone, he does the same he did during Stage 2, but may also bite them as well. That way, they go back to the party with a bite mark on their neck and no knowledge of how it got there. Which a paranoid party may take as a sign of untrustworthiness or outright collusion.

Charm a party member or allied NPC, then use Sending or a pre-established Rary's Telepathic Bond to get them to do suspicious things or things harmful to the party. As Strahd does not need to be in humanoid form to Charm targets, he can establish the Charm as a bat.

Use Seeming to 'replace' someone (or multiple someones). For example, sneak into the Blue Water Inn and temporarily incapacitate the Martikovs and some or all of the patrons. Replace them with cultists (for anyone the party needs to talk to) and undead, all masked into looking 'normal' with Seeming. When the party realizes something is off, attack. Seeming doesn't drop just because combat started, so this will cause all manner of chaos. For extra fun, have a few genuinely uninvolved innocents mixed in there, just to see if the freaked out PCs end up killing innocent bystanders.

Use Seeming on the party--make them look like monsters or Vampire Spawn. Enjoy the fact that they are stuck out in the wilderness for the night, or getting attacked by allies. Or even other PCs.

Alternately, Strahd can use Disguise Self or Alter Self to personally replace an individual for the purpose of talking with the PCs--he may even replace a PC for a short while. For example, if he catches a PC alone he can incapacitate them and hand them off to a minion. He takes their form and returns to the party, and continues along with them for a short while. In a short while, they happen upon a coffin lying in the road...just as they arrive, the actual PC wakes up inside the coffin. Strahd lets the "who is the real one!?" drama play out for a moment, then drops the disguise, thanks the party for their company, and departs.

Strahd sends a PC a bag of money with a note, thanking them for some obscure 'service.'

Strahd may start making subtle overtures towards a PC he thinks he can corrupt

Adopt a disguised 'role' that he plays, and be friendly with the NPCs.

Try to get the PCs to dislike/distrust the actual decent people in the valley and make friends with Strahd's servants. (In my game so far, the PCs are very buddy-buddy with the Vistani that live outside Vallaki). In the case of the Vistani, make up some BS about how Strahd has a non-aggression pact with them as part of their 'we can come and go freely from Barovia.' Make them think that their Vistani 'allies' are the only folk in the valley that are 'safe' from Strahd. NOTE: Strahd's servants are smart enough to keep their true allegiance a secret.

Stage 4: Break Them

Strahd is ready to start breaking his toys now. Continue anything he was doing in Stage 3, but turn it up to 11.

If Strahd has found a PC he can isolate from the rest, his goal with them is to make it so that this person dislikes their 'allies' enough that, while charmed, he can command them to turn on their friends. Perhaps even get them to do it voluntarily.

Capitalize on any seeds of distrust and paranoia planted in Stage 3. Make note of what worked and what didn't, and double down on the points that worked.

Strahd begins using creative combat tactics (see below) on a regular basis, and many foes will be under his command. He may even directly lead strike teams to harm the party.

Additional example ideas for how Strahd may interact

Dominate someone the party likes and force them to attack the party

Make offers to the party (such as 'Bring me Ireena and I'll let you leave.'). If possible, manipulate/lie about the results of agreement or disagreement.

Allow them to find a suit of armor...either the presently-inert Animated Armor in the Tower of Khazan, or Strahd's Animated Armor. The armor has been throughly worked over with Nystul's Magic Aura to hide its true nature. Let them enjoy the armor...then, in the final battle, activate the armor.

Spread rumors to lead PCs to cursed items (such as the Staff of Frost in the Amber Temple) that may corrupt them

Manipulate someone (non-evil) into setting the Assassin bound to the magic mirror on one of the PCs. Charm them while in disguise and lie to them about what the mirror does (tell them it will summon a spectral warrior to go to the PCs' aid if they speak the rhyme and say a PC's name.)

If the Revenants at Argynvostholt are still around, see to it that they find out the PCs are aiming to kill Strahd.

Use Dream to harass a PC, hiding the fact that Strahd is sending the dream. If targeting a Cleric or Paladin, make it seem like a Dream from their deity, informing them that Strahd cannot be killed, they can only seek to redeem him. Or that Strahd must live on and suffer, rather than being killed. Alternately, give them a Dream about Madame Eva sending them an 'extra prophecy' to aid them along their way. In short, give them dreams that give them disruptive/false information.

If the PCs have experience with Strahd replacing people, use Suggestion to get an NPC the PCs know well to behave in a way that is out of character for them...see if the PCs' paranoia fires off and makes them harm/kill a friend.

Use Seeming to make innocents look like monsters, try to get the PCs to attack them. Drop the spell after about half of them are dead.

If the party has acquired any of the Relics, use trickery and other people to try to take it from them.

Spread copious amounts of misinformation throughout the valley. Rumors that the sunsword is cursed to gradually overtake the mind of its wielder, that overuse of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind will turn you into a Raven, that one of the PCs or someone they know was seen conversing with a vampire spawn in the middle of the night (when the rest of the party was in bed), rumors of powerful useful things in the mountains to the North, rumors of a cult in Krezk, and so on. Just make up a bunch of bull-crap and spread it around. The best part with this is that no Insight check can prove these false...because the PCs are hearing this information second or third-hand, likely from someone who believes it to be true...Insight or even Zone of Truth doesn't help you against someone who is simply wrong.

Stage 5: Obliterate

The party is too dangerous to be left alive or has enraged Strahd. He wants them dead. The gloves are off. However, Strahd is still a highly intelligent and successful general. He's not going to just hurl himself at them in a wild fury and immediately fight to the death. No, he's going to wear them down and deplete their resources--so that when he goes for the kill, it's easy. This is how you force the final confrontation...the PCs' best move is to go on the offensive as soon as possible--the longer they wait around while Strahd is doing this, the harder their life is going to become.

Strahd is done playing. If he thinks a PC can be corrupted, he makes his move. If not, they die.

Strahd knows how dangerous the PCs have become and begins using attrition-style warfare to wear them down. Attacks against the PCs are always conducted with a goal in mind: Kill that character, acquire that item, destroy that location, etc. Strahd can always make more undead, he can always turn new Vampire Spawn. If he sacrifices a half-dozen Spawn and a large number of zombies to get his hands on the Sunsword or kill a single PC, that counts as a win in his book.

Strahd begins destroying the PCs' network of allies. If possible, he kills these NPCs in front of the PCs (Wall of Force/Drain them dry, for example). Once the PCs realize what is going on and start avoiding their allies, they start getting reports that their friends are all being killed. NPCs with a shakier relationship with the PCs may turn on them to try to protect themselves.

If Strahd has a mole among them, now is the time to strike.

Strahd seeks to compromise or destroy their base of operations. He wants them isolated and exhausted.

Strahd is more careful in combat, especially if the party has Sunlight-producing relics. He may avoid the front lines, using his forces instead of taking the field directly.

Strahd's targeting of their allies and safe places is aimed at demoralizing them as well as destroying assets. Killed allies should be killed horribly and/or turned into Vampires/Undead to be used against the PCs. If the resulting undead is capable of speech, then they should be forced to curse and scream at the PCs, blaming them for what was done to them.

If the PCs have made 'friends' with any of Strahd's servants, now is the time for a precision-strike betrayal. Attack them in their sleep, poison their food, whatever hurts the most.

The Final Battle

So, here we are. The party has gathered their artifacts, rallied themselves, and marched on Castle Ravenloft. So, how do we make this a Battle worthy of Legends? Strahd is...not actually that durable. In the face of the Sunsword, the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, St. Markovia's Thighbone, and the Icon of Ravenloft...if Strahd tries to fight them straight up, he's going to go down like a chump. So, here we go...

Disclaimer: if you completely follow my advice here, you're probably headed for a TPK. Pick the pieces you like and implement them (or go whole hog and TPK em, up to you)

Prepare for them

Strahd knows they are coming. Of course he knows. So, let's get ready for them.

Swap out his spell list. The spells listed in his statblock are what I consider his day-to-day overlording loadout. If he's going to war, he should switch out for more appropriate spells. Consider where your party is set to have their Final Battle with Strahd, and pick whatever spells off the Wizard spell list are the most advantageous. (For example, Gust of Wind is kind of useless in the crypts...but if he's fighting them on top of the castle, punting the party off the side is awesome).

If the party includes a Paladin or other caster with a Detect Evil/Divine Sense capability, prepare and Cast Nystul's Magic Aura on himself. Change his apparent creature type to humanoid to confound their spell.

Wear the party down. If the party shows up to battle Strahd and is at full strength, he didn't do his job right. You have an army. Use it.

Gear up. If you want drama, let Strahd summon it onto himself as a Bonus Action...but if Strahd's Armor is still around, he puts it on. This gives him an even higher AC, immunity to lightning damage, and a lightning-based ranged attack. And a lightning-damage dealing sword, if he wants to use that instead of his claws. (For fun...have him hold off on doing this for a bit...where he just plays with the PCs like a big cat. Then he goes "I suppose that's enough playing around. Time to die." :Snaps his fingers and armor materializes around him:)

As DM, study the area he will be fighting them in. What's around it, above it, below it? Where can Strahd go to buy himself a few rounds to recover? Look at the Battle section below and figure out how Strahd plans to tackle this.

The Battle

Go time. Note that some of these recommendations may contradict the number of spell slots he has (such as suggesting using Seeming but also suggesting using Wall of Force, despite the fact that he only has the one 5th level spell slot). This is to give options to you.

Action Economy disparity sucks. Crowd Control is Strahd's friend. Polymorph, Hypnotic Pattern, Wall of Force, and anything else that takes PCs out of the fight tilts things in his favor. The fewer attacks being leveled at him per round, the better.

Kite your enemies. Strahd can walk through walls to put stout stone between himself and sunlight-producing artifacts, and can lure the PCs to chase him...either into other enemies, or into traps. Strahd knows where all his traps are, of course...so why wouldn't he lead the PCs into them? Remember, Strahd has Spider Climb and can go through floors and ceilings. Doing this also gives him time out of sunlight in order to regenerate HP.

Abuse Seeming to devour party resources. Strahd can make an arbitrarily large number of minions look like him before the PCs show up. Have decoy Strahds all over the place...use them as sacrificial pawns to lure the party to bad places. For extra evil...when the party finds Strahd at the appointed location, they are likely to open big. Unload on him with everything they've got to try to Alpha him down. So, have the 'Strahd' they find be a Vampire Spawn under Seeming. They nuke 'Strahd' and blow all their best tricks...likely reducing the spawn to dust. The party stands there for a second going "Um...is that it?" Then Strahd's laughter starts echoing through the room and he either suckerpunches someone from behind, or several more 'Strahds' show up (maybe one of them is even the real thing!)

Charm people. Pre-emptively, if possible. Convincing the Fighter or Paladin to hand over the Sunsword, or pitch it off the side of the castle is a great way to get rid of a serious hazard to your health.

Target Priority. In my experience, it's sort of common for DMs to 'play along' and have the monsters fight the martial characters for the most part. Strahd's not an idiot, though...what's the point of playing around with the walking ball of armor when the squishy wizard is blowing him up, or the healer is undoing his efforts to murder you. Pick your targets based on who it would hurt the party the most to lose.

Isolate Sunlight wielders. These are the most directly dangerous foes, as they produce an aura that hurts you, blocks your regen, AND prevents you from going Mist-form if you are defeated. Polymorph them, enclose them in a cubic Wall of Stone, lock them in rooms by themselves, use minions to knock them into traps

Separate the party. Strahd can close and lock doors as a lair action. If his lair action comes up and the party is divided between rooms with a door in between them...slam the door shut and lock it, then suckerpunch whichever half of the party is the most vulnerable (or painful to lose).

Exploit your speed. If Strahd is going full-out, he can cover 150' in a round. (Move, Dash, LA-movex3). Nobody can catch him when he wants to outpace you.

Exploit your absurd stealth check. Given that Strahd can pass through walls and outrun everyone, breaking line of sight is easy. Strahd should be striking from Stealth on a regular basis. The party should not 'catch' Strahd, he should loop around and suckerpunch them while they are chasing him. Of note: Strahd can use Lair Actions without breaking stealth. Go sneaky, then use the Specter and Shadow Lair Actions to reduce HP and Str values across the party. Prioritize with the Shadows, of course...aim for the Str-dependent characters.

If you can go outside onto the rooftops or ramparts, enjoy the fact that the weather is on Strahd's side. For a climactic encounter like this, there should be a full-blown thunderstorm on. The rain should limit visibility and make perilous footing (like the rooftops) even more dangerous. Strahd's spider climb lets him basically ignore the perilous footing.

Ration your Legendary Resistances. Turn Undead is not a big deal. Accept the turning, activate the 'walk through walls' lair action, then leave the party feeling foolish while Strahd runs off to go regenerate all his hitpoints, and a party member is down a Channel Divinity. You can always flee to regen health as well, so unless it would put him dangerously close to death, don't worry about failing saves vs. damage. No, the big threats are the ones that prevent Strahd from moving. As long as Strahd can move, he can put a solid object between himself and the PCs and can regenerate health. (Tactically, your best option to beat Strahd like this is to pop Wall of Force to make a box trapping him and you in one place.)

Bring in allies. If there are still enemies in the castle, call them in or lead the party to them. Certainly Rahadin would spring to his master's aid if he knew Strahd was under attack.

Try to lead the party away from your crypt. If Strahd is killed and isn't in sunlight when he dies, he turns to mist and flows back to his coffin. Once he gets there, you have 1 hour to finish him off or he regains consciousness, then rapidly regenerates all his hitpoints (regeneration feature starts working again). And you're back to square one.

Ultimately, the final battle with Strahd should range all over the castle. The more the party has explored and cleared the castle before fighting Strahd, the less likely they are to die horribly. Strahd won't have many allies left to lead them to and the party should have figured out where the traps are. You could even have it that allies of the party who have survived up to this point get involved in little ways. As an off-the-cuff example...suppose Strahd convinced someone to pitch the Sunsword off the side of the castle. At a dramatically appropriate moment, one of the Keepers of the Feather (in Raven form) drops the sword in a PC's hands.

Conclusion

So, there you have it. My notes on playing Strahd. Enjoy! (I have another pair of these in the works...one on Ezmerelda, one on Ireena.)

This is a very, very thorough post. Let me add my thoughts, based on experience from my own campaign.

Psychological Warfare
 5. Strahd's campaign against the PCs should be psychological warfare heavy.

This is incredibly important, and is only briefly touched upon by this post. Strahd has weaknesses, and it is in his best interests to hide those weaknesses from the party, so thoroughly that they argue for him, and against his detractors.

Strahd 'owning' everything in Barovia felt to me as a cop-out. However, there's nothing preventing him from getting an invitation to enter a residence, the day before he needs to use it. Invitations don't expire. Also, charming NPCs into inviting him inside works wonders.

Strahd's weakness to sunlight. Use. The. Crystal. Heart. Once the party has acquired a source of sunlight suchs as the sword, or a divine spell, Strahd can invite the party to dinner and openly ask them what they know of vampires. He then offers all the common rumours about weakness to sunlight, needing to sleep in a coffin during the day, having to stab them through the heart with a stake, all that. Your goal is to leave the party wondering "Why is the BBG telling us how to kill him?" That's when you use the heart. Strahd asks the wielder of the Sunsword if he may borrow it briefly (promising to return it), or asks the Cleric to cast their spell on him. He basks in the sunlight and makes it clear he doesn't care, while the Heart absorbs all the damage dealt to him. This is then when Strahd tells the party that he is the Prime Vampire. The first vampire to ever be created, and the only one like him. Do not outright lie, as you want any Insight checks for lies to come up as 'He is not lying.'

Use Strahd's lair actions and combine them with his spellcasting. If the dinner occurs after one of the party members has permanently died, he can use his 'Summon Wight' lair action, combined with the illusion in the dining room, to make the wight look like the 'ghost' of the dead party member.

Here, your lives, your very souls, belong... to me.

Strahd can, and will, play nice. He'll give the party gifts, if they acquiesce to his requests. He'll answer any of their many questions, truthfully and to the best of his ability, he will be hospitable and welcoming. He will be respectful, and stately. He will test their commitment to their ideals.

In my own campaign, Strahd's very first 'test' was this phrase:

You may freely explore the upper levels of my home. Be warned, however, for I rarely host... guests. However, the levels of the castle below this one, are strictly off-limits.

Will the party respect his request and statement, and not stray into the basement? It's quite simple, assuming the party has no reason to go there other than curiosity.

You want to make it as easy as possible for the party to respect Strahd's wishes. The more they come to trust that he is not working against them, the easier it will be to manipulate them.

Manipulation
Strahd is a master manipulator. Why do something yourself, if you can make someone else do it for you, and then thank YOU for allowing them to do it?

Here's an example scenario:

Strahd 'failed' to secure the Church of St. Andral, and the bones have been returned, and Ireena is currently hiding in the church. Now, Strahd could send cultists, druids or werewolves as OP's post suggests, or, he could send the party. Naturally, the party isn't going to be very keen to hand Ireena over to him just like that. So here's what happened in my campaign, as Strahd manipulated the Hags at Bonegrinder Windmill and the party into conflict, forcing the party to take refuge in the Church, and then kidnap Ireena and hand her to Strahd, all without the party knowing it was Strahd's plan.

Strahd invites the party to dinner, after buying all of Morgantha's Dream Pastries. Morgantha returns to the Windmill to make more pastries, completing the coven right as the party passes by on their way to dinner with Strahd. The screams of crushed children attract party attention and a fight erupts. The hags, if beaten, retreat to the Ethereal plane. At the Castle, Strahd plays the gracious host, consoling the wounded and weary party, allowing them to rest in the safety of his home. When dinner arrives, Strahd offers the party a choice between Ireena and something they cannot refuse: they may only choose one. This 'something' must be something the party cannot afford to pass on, up to and including allowing a member of the party to leave Barovia and return home.

After the party has made their choice and (most likely) not chosen Ireena, Strahd follows through on his end of the bargain immediately, as the party eats poisoned food (that's been disguised by Nystul's Magic Aura). The poison is a DC 17 Con Save (Strahd's save DC) or after 4 hours, gain 1 stack of exhaustion. Strahd then tells the party to leave. Poison may not be necessary, and the delay in application should make it hazy as to if it really was Strahd who poisoned them.

Outside the safety of the castle, the bereaved Night Hags will use their Nightmare Haunting ability to prevent members of the party from sleeping, causing them to gain an additional stack of exhaustion each night. Make sure your players know, mechanically, they die if they reach 6 stacks. Cue party panic as they have no way of dealing with Hags they can't touch.

The only solution, other than fleeing back into Castle Ravenloft (the drawbridge is up, showing that's unwelcome), is to seek refuge in the Hallowed Church of St. Andral, where the Night Hags cannot go.

Once the party is in the church, Strahd sends an agent to deliver a message:

This was not part of your arrangement with the Dark Lord. You are now instructed to deliver Ireena to the south gate, tonight, at midnight.

Now the party has a decision to make. Defy the will of the Dark Lord and renege on their deal, or comply with his demands? Either way, the Night Hags are still out there.

My party complied, delivered Ireena to Strahd in the dead of night and dusted their hands of the whole situation. One even said "I think we handled that well."

Little did they know, that every step of their journey had been carefully orchestrated by Strahd, from ensuring the Night hags were all present at the Windmill, to the party's entry into a doomed bargain. Why fight your enemies, or do any of the legwork yourself, when you can manipulate others into doing it for you?

General Notes
Strahd will want to claim a body part from each of the characters at some point. A finger, a section of their skin, something more tangible than their hair. During the final battle, he can 'kill' the characters and then have a minion in the dungeons use the resurrection Dark Power from the Amber Temple, to resurrect the character using this body part. Now, if the party attempts to resurrect their dead comrade, the spell will fail as the soul is already in a new body. Oh, and the new body was resurrected inside one of Strahd's dungeon cells. Make sure to have Strahd vocally reassert his dominance over the souls of the dead within his domain.

Speaking of Dark Gifts, much of Strahd's illusory repertoire breaks down once the party has access to True Sight from the Amber Temple. Keep this in mind during the late game.

Similarly, be careful turning players into Revenants. The only way Strahd can hide from a Revenant is by using his Nightmare Stead to hide on the Ethereal Plane. The party always knowing where the true Strahd is, is a super powerful tool.

Consider allowing each of the 'seeds' from the Winery, to increase the Crystal Heart's HP by 50. The location of the third seed is never disclosed in the module, so I chose to have mine powering the Heart at the start of the game, giving it its 50 HP. Allowing Strahd to collect the other seeds later in the campaign gives him an objective that doesn't directly involve the party (making him seem more 'real') and when he does acquire them, boosts his tankability substantially, which is one of his weak points.

Strahd has absolutely crafted a Shield Guardian for himself.

Be prepared for the party to use the 'True Resurrection' Dark Gift, to resurrect Argonvost, or Queen Ravenova.

The best location for the final fight to occur (for Strahd) is the bone room, in the basement. It's Desecrated Ground, which grants undead in the area advantage on all saving throws (and shores up another of Strahd's weaknesses, namely his susceptibility to magic). He can also wall-phase into the stairwell that adjoins the room, yet has no physical room access.

Losing control of your character sucks. As odd as it sounds, try to avoid using Strahd's Charm ability on player-characters during combat, as it drastically impacts player agency. Target NPC companions instead, even if they auto-fail the save as a consequence.

Additionally, Strahd never does anything for only one reason. Everything he does is to achieve as much as possible, with as little effort as possible. Harassing the party should be done because he wants to distract them from something else, and expend their resources. It's usually very easy to think up a second reason why Strahd would do something, but it's always worth thinking about, if only to better roleplay a character who has spent the last 500 years perfecting his art.

As a final note, always try to fail forward. Strahd is a tactical and military genius. When he plans, he assumes that plan will fail, and so has a second plan for when it does. Out-thinking Strahd should be difficult if not impossible. Take liberties with timing. If it took you a week of thought and planning to come up with a plan, Strahd did it in a few hours. If you need something that's permanently affected by Nystul's Magic Aura, then Strahd thought of this eventuality 29.9 days ago.

Strahd is very good at what he does; and he is always in control.

And because this didn't fit in the original post....

A few specific call-outs for handy spells...

Nystul's Magic Aura: Allows Strahd to obscure his creature type from all forms of detection magic. This is critically important if you want Strahd to disguise himself to mess with the PCs directly--especially if you have a Paladin in the party. A lot of PCs forget this spell exists, enjoy how confused they are when their good human buddy Vasili turns out to be a vampire.

Wall of X: Battlefield Control is awesome. A special mention goes out to Wall of Force, as a bubble of that spell may let him isolate a single character so he can freely drain them dry in front of others, without risk of being interrupted. Wall of Stone is also useful because it lets him enclose someone generating Sunlight in an opaque box from which they can't bother him.

Glyph of Warding: Perhaps the most useful base-defense spell in the game.

Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum: For making a prison that hides people from divination magic, or seeding 'dead zones' around the castle that he can hide in if being tracked magically.

Negative Energy Flood: Heal undead minions

Life Transference: Strahd's resistance to Necrotic damage means this won't be as effective coming from him. But he heals at 20hp per round, which is more damage than the spell is likely to do to him. But, it lets him heal Beucephalus or other minions--particularly useful when he himself is not in combat.

Far Step: And you thought he was fast before...

Any enchantment spell that makes the target potentially attack its allies

Dream: For when you want to screw with the PCs in their sleep

Seeming: For disguising squads of undead monsters as perfectly ordinary commoners

Disguise Self: Because obviously

Mislead: Functional tele-presence. Allows Strahd to directly converse with the PCs while putting himself at no risk.

Fabricate: Oh, you fled across a river to get away from my and my spawn? That's cute, here let me magick a bridge up out of nowhere.

Fly: Extremely useful for anyone

Leomund's Tiny Hut: Why would he not put this up over his coffin every day?

Sending: Secure communication. Extra useful on a Charmed target.

Seeming: Wait...Strahd can made a 30' radius horde of his minions all look exactly like him? Or like the party's best NPC friends? Awesome!

Modify Memory: Sometimes you don't want people to remember something.

Rary's Telepathic Bond: Great for commanding a Charmed creature.

Polymorph: Only being able to turn into a Bat or Wolf is lame. And turning enemies into newts is always fun

Summon Greater Demon: Because dropping a CR 5 demon on someone's head is a great option to have. Especially when you can just drop through the floor to avoid any nasty repercussions of it breaking free of your control. It's a great "Here, play with this for a while while I go downstairs to recover some HP" option.

Animate Objects: 10 tiny objects is downright murderous...as a PC, I have completely upended combat encounters by burying my enemies in a swarm of animated ball bearings.

Unbelievably helpful. Your PCs are not wrong that you might have a bit of Evil in you. My only regret is that I'm reading this at the end of my CoS campaign and didn't have the creativity and cleverness to think of these things for my players. You have, though, given me some fantastic inspiration for the upcoming final few sessions.

Well done, sir or madam. Truly an incredible read. Thank you for sharing!

I’m planning a run of COS, and Ive been trying to think about Strahd’s underlying objectives with the party. My thinking is that he knows that the dark powers will never let him have ireena, at least, not as long as he is their plaything. So in searching for a successor, he is searching for someone corruptible, and leading them to the Amber temple. He figures if he can break them to the point of being willing to take one of the dark powers, perhaps they will be able to take his place. With a new Dark lord in Barovia, maybe he can finally have his freedom - and Ireena. Of course, should the players take the dark powers, Strahds pride will get the better of him and he will fight for his lordship. Or alternatively, he will try to leave with Ireena once they accept the gift, and he will fly into a rage when he realizes he is not liberated.

does this seem reasonable? How would you go about expanding it? I want to make sure Strahd’s motives are sensible.

Well, I can only tell you how I'd run it...and my way of doing it is based on old 2E Ravenloft lore.

The catch is..."finding a successor" is not how you get out of being a Darklord. Strahd thinks this is the case--he thinks he can find someone to replace him and thus free himself from his imprisonment in Barovia--but he's wrong.

The Dark Powers that are the true rulers of Ravenloft seem to have a relatively straight-forward goal: Supply individuals with what they need to do greater and greater acts of evil (don't tempt them into evil, just equip those who already are being evil). Most will eventually become functional monsters that inhabit the lands, gradually transformed by the 'gifts' of the Dark Powers. But certain rare individuals provide the right mix of desire and spectacular evil that they get 'promoted' to Darklord. The Dark Powers carve out a little pocket of reality for them and lock them in there. The new Darklord rules over this domain...but this is where the Dark Powers perform their true acts...

The Darklords are trapped into an endless karmic prison, wherein the Dark Powers will torture them with their greatest desires for all time. If you try to play a switch game with the Dark Powers and manage to trigger the birth of a new Darklord, they don't replace you...they just get whisked off by the Mists and given a new domain wherein they will be a new chew toy for the Dark Powers.

The only way that the Dark Powers will release a Darklord is if the tortures they are inflicting on said Darklord stop working. If a Darklord gives up on their greatest desire--the lynchpin that the Dark Powers use to torment them...then the Dark Powers might release them.

For example: Azalin Rex is a lich Darklord who performed catastrophic acts of evil in his never-ending pursuit of more and more arcane might. He rules over a vast kingdom and is a mighty spellcaster...but the Dark Powers have cursed him such that he (like all Darklords) cannot leave his own domain...and is permanently incapable of ever learning or developing any new form of magic. And yet he never stops trying...increasing his arcane power is Azalin's sole obsession and he is constantly scheming and plotting and experimenting, trying to work out how to work his way around the curse.

In the same way, Strahd ceaselessly pursues Tatyana--never once giving up. For centuries, he has tried again and again to woo and turn Tatyana's reincarnations...and has failed, every single time. And yet he won't stop.

This is not something he can get out of by 'switching' with somebody. As long as the Dark Powers can torture him with Tatyana's endless reincarnations, they will never, ever let him go. Barovia is Strahd's own personal Hell. Only by owning up to his past, by acknowledging his cruelty, and by admitting that Tatyana is not 'his.' By voluntarily letting her go and accepting that she is a free individual and he has no claim over her, nor does he desire one...that's how he can get out. When Tatyana's reincarnations live long lives, free from Strahd's attempts to woo her because he has truly given up on her (not 'I'm going to let this one go...I'll get the next one,' but a genuine, permanent release)...then the Dark Powers may decide they are done with him.

But it'll never happen. And the Dark Powers know it. They choose their torture devices well.

Now, that's not to say that Strahd knows this. It's not like the Dark Powers handed him a manual on how his eternal imprisonment and torture was going to work. Trying to 'switch' with a PC could be yet another one of his (doomed) attempts to work around the Dark Powers to get at Tatyana.

Oh, and a note of warning: Many players take Dark Gifts when playing CoS. I've heard tell from many DMs where they had PCs take virtually every Gift in the building, without any prompting on Strahd's part. If Strahd is trying to create a replacement...just talking a Dark Gift isn't enough. He has to try to get someone to be sufficiently, spectacularly evil in order to get the Dark Powers (not the 'Vestiges' living in the Amber Temple, the actual Dark Powers) to descend on them.

Thanks - I certainly don't intend for it to work. Strahd is stuck. But I'm just trying to figure out a solid reason that he would actually be interested in the party. The whole "successor" plot line doesn't make sense to me if it isn't an attempt for him to escape his prison.

With that in mind, I really want to play up the aspect of Strahd trying to corrupt the players. What I was thinking was that each artifact would have been placed by strahd in a way that in order to take it, they would need to perform some act that stretches their boundaries, morally. For example, I really like the idea of the dog down in Death house to give the players a choice - do I sacrifice an innocent, or do I risk my own life here?

I Want to give my players choices like that with increasing rewards for being evil and increasing difficulties for chosing the moral path. All of this, of course, orchestrated by Strahd in an attempt to morally corrupt these adventurers to a point that they may be able to take his place. Can you think of any good places that I might be able to insert these moral dilemmas for the players?

Sure...here are some ideas for ya...

Specific Ideas

The Obvious One: Ireena. Early in the game, Strahd should be pretty okay with the party running around with Ireena. As time progresses, he should start leaning on the party to hand her over/convince her to join him/whatever. Offers them a magic item in exchange for the girl...or passage out of the valley. Do you condemn an innocent, unwilling girl to becoming the toy of a vampire, or get neat loot. (Naturally, due to the Curse, this will likely result in Ireena's death however it goes down).

The Vallaki Issue: In Vallaki...there really isn't a Right Decision. Do you support Vallakovich, his happiness laws, and tyrrany? Do you support Wachter and her devil-worshipping cult? Do you throw them both down, go for a third option, and destabilize the town? What do you do when challenged by guards who are just doing their job...submit and deal with the fallout, or kill them and render the town less able to defend itself? Honestly...supporting Wachter is the 'easiest' solution. She'll take over the town, reward you for your aid, let you stay in town whenever you'd like (probably for free). But she's likely to start feeding citizens to devils and opening the gates for Strahd and his forces...not to mention that she'll probably burn down the church at her first opportunity.

Krezk: Double-down on Baron Krezkov's unwillingness to let the party in. Perhaps wine isn't enough and he simply doesn't give the party a quest that would convince him to let him in (let there be something they can do...like wiping out the werewolves and saving the kids they took...he just doesn't vocalize this). Dimitri is just trying to protect his people...adventurers are nothing but trouble. The PCs can learn about the werewolves abducting Krezk kids, and D. Krezkov will let them in as thanks for that...but it should be the sort of thing they have to discover. It is far easier to resort to infiltration or force to get into Krezk than to convince them to let you in.

Strahd being manipulative. Look through a lot of my "suggestions for what Strahd can do" notes above. There are a lot of those that pit players against innocents. (What do they do if Strahd is controlling a random housewife and forces her to blitz them with a knife? Or tells her to do it or he'll kill her children?). Strahd could also manipulate the PCs into doing something that they'll only realize after-the-fact was pure evil.

Make some sub-villains sympathetic. In my game, Luvash (one of the brothers who runs the Vallaki Vistani camp) is a doting father. He's this colossal thug-looking guy who is absolutely wrapped around Arabelle's finger. He also happens to be a devoted servant of Strahd. My PCs really like the guy and think his antics are adorable, they think he's on their side. Basically, they trust him more than they trust most of the people in Vallaki. This gives you a point of leverage: someone in Strahd's corner that the PCs trust.

Play up the assholery of some side NPCs. For example, Bildrath of Bildrath's mercantile. He charges 10x the value of anything he sells, and is a non-sympathetic turd about it. The party may be inclined to rob him rather than pay him.

Spread misinformation. Tell the PCs that something needs an act of evil to accomplish and have them learn of it second-hand (so an Insight Check can't tell it's not true...the person telling them thinks it is true.) For example: getting into the Amber Temple requires a pint of untainted human blood, unwillingly given (and make sure that human enemies make themselves scarce during this time). Items made of silver that have been inherited within a family for at least 3 generations can harm a vampire or repel werewolves or whatever (and, of course, no one with such an item is willing to part with it). The dying words of the innocent are prophetic. And so on. For extra evil, Strahd can engineer situations that make this look legit (find out that the PCs stole an inherited silver item and command werewolves to flee when presented with it, only for them to stop faking some time later).

General advice

Don't go for big grand acts of evil right away. Murdering puppies, letting harm come to children, randomly murdering people...that's how you get a "No, that's evil, I won't do that!" response.

Start small. Put the party in front of things they need, but aren't for sale...or the seller is charging an exorbitant amount for it. Put a guard who is 'just doing his job' in their way, or have them get arrested. Present them with inconveniences that are easily solved by minor crimes.

Escalate, mostly focused on enemies. Have an exceptionally obstinate enemy captive who is quite responsive to torture, but basically immune to any other form of persuasion. Get your players used to doing cruel things to their foes before you try to get them to be cruel to neutral or innocent characters.

The Touch of the Dark Powers

As I mentioned above, (this is from Ravenloft lore) the Dark Powers encourage (and equip) evil once it starts. The way they do this is gradual. If you really want to play up the corruptive nature of Ravenloft, you can draw some of these ideas into your game.

When the Dark Powers witness an act of intentional, deliberate evil, they may descend on the individual who committed the act. The severity of the act increases the chances that they'll act (ranging from 1% to 10% to an 'Act of Ultimate Darkness' where the DM picks whatever % chance they want). When they do, the slowly begin transforming the individual into some sort of monster. The effect starts off subtle--little changes that are easy to escape notice--then grow progressively more pronounced as the individual continues down the path of evil. It works like this:

When the Dark Powers descend on you, you are granted a gift and a curse. Early on, the gift will always be greater than the curse--making it seem like the curse is worth it. The Gift is always something associated with whatever you did to earn it. Something that makes it easier to do it again. The curse may be a penalty to something opposed to the gift, or physical disfigurement, or something else entirely.

Each subsequent time that the Dark Powers descend, they expand upon both the Gift and the Curse. As their acts of evil continue, the gifts and curses become progressively more powerful until (for most individuals) they are wholly transformed into a monster (or something that's basically-like that monster). In general, this occurs over 5 'steps' of Gift/Curse. Use creatures from the MM as a hint towards how to develop the gifts and curses of an individual.

Let's look at an example: one from the actual Curse of Strahd module. A character who makes the most sense if you consider that he's in the midst of being transformed by the Dark Powers: Izek Strazni

Izek has Expertise in Intimidation, and the arm off a Barbed Devil (go check, it's the same arm with the same Hurl Flame feature). He is also a Horrible Person. So, I expanded on him a little (then my PCs killed him before much of it could be shown off...oh well) in line with this.

Izek is at Stage 3 of his corruption. His actions towards Ireena (a family member and an innocent--doing harm to such a person is a quick way to get the Dark Powers on you) could rapidly progress him towards Stage 5 (full monster). Here's the listing of his Gift/Curse pairs as he has been descending towards evil. His 'gifts' are in line with his penchant towards using violence and intimidation to get what he wants.

Gains Expertise in Intimidate. Suffers Disadvantage on all other Charisma checks

Gain Brute feature. Suffers the following: If attacked or harmed, must make a DC 13 Wisdom Saving Throw or enter a violent rage that lasts until no enemies are left.

Gains arm of a Barbed Devil and the Hurl Flame feature. The terror of his monstrous arm causes all non-Intimidate Charisma Checks to automatically fail. Starting Attitudes towards him are degraded by one step (Friendly to Indifferent. Indifferent to Hostile)

(FUTURE) Gains the hide of a Barbed Devil (Natural AC 15, gains Barbed Hide feature). When enraged (from Level 2 curse) cannot tell Friend from Foe.

(FUTURE) Full transformation into a Barbed Devil (Except for Skills)

As you can see, his Gift makes it easier to solve his problems in an offensive, intimidating, violent fashion...steadily pushing him more and more towards 'solve everything with violence.' And the curses make it harder for him to not solve all his problems that way.

A few examples off the top of my head of 'starting' curses to get you started...

The character gains Advantage on Thieves' Tools checks to pick locks, but their hands turn pitch black.

The character's grip becomes so strong that they can inflict 1d4 bludgeoning damage with Unarmed Strikes, but if they try to pick up a fragile item they must make a Strength Check against that item's AC (see DMG), breaking it on a success.

The character's ears becoming extremely acute: they have Advantage on Perception Checks that rely on hearing, but loud noises (such as Thunder damage happening near them) requires them to make a DC 15 Con Save or be Deafened for 1d4 rounds.

The character grows claws, allowing them to inflict 1d4 slashing damage with an Unarmed Strike, but suffer Disadvantage on any skill check requiring fine manipulation, as the claws get in the way.

Also look at any of the Dark Gifts provided in the Adventurer's League DM's Guide for Curse of Strahd, and the expansions on those that are floating around--they make a great place to start.

Redemption

It is possible to reverse course. Shedding the 'gifts' of Ravenloft is possible, but generally requires a lot of work. As a rule, an individual must again face the same sort of situation that caused them to 'fall' in the first place, and stay the path of righteousness in the face of it, something made harder by their curses.

I'm tearing up and smiling so much reading through this. This is EXCELLENT work, and you are a master DM. Very, very well done. I am more than halfway through running my group through CoS, and this makes me want to do it all over again for a second run-through. I am DEFINITELY going to take as much of this advice as possible for the final encounters.

Brilliant! I especially like how so much of it follows what is based on Strahd's specific capabilities as delimited in the adventure, not just "have Strahd suddenly appear with a bunch of minions because he has perfect knowledge of everything in Barovia at all times."

Please do Ireena next!

Woah. I now realise I had begun thinking of Strahd, but not actually plotting him out. Haven't read everything (yet!), but certainly coming back to this topic :)

My party just encountered Strahd for the first time in our last session and i was looking into how to develop Strahd from that encounter to the next ones and god this was so useful. Thanks so much for this. I'm so looking forward to mess with my players' minds over the next sessions haha
